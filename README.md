# CalcPiWithBlocks
Inspired by a 3 blue 1 brown youtube video i decided to calculate pi using elastic collisions and weighted blocks, 
has a weird visual glitch when more than 2 digits are calulated but it was a fun 10 minute project. Maxs out at
5 digits as no larger number for largeKg can fit, could be fixed with a different primitive type but i was happy with 5
